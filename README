Development branches:

  - alix7:     This is the most recent branch for the next release alix6. Use this a base of your active development.
  - master:    This will always be the branch of the latest release. After a new release the
               specific branch will be merged into this one.

Test branches:

  - future:   This branch is for testing purposes only. I use it to test some long-distance changes.
